## 📁 Modules Overview

🔢 **Array**  
Basic array operations, insertion, deletion, and searching algorithms.

📚 **Stack**  
Implementation of stack using array and linked list with push, pop, peek operations.

📥 **Queue**  
Queue operations using array and linked list, including circular queue implementation.

🔗 **Linked List**  
Singly, doubly, and circular linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal.

🌲 **Tree**  
Binary tree creation, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), and binary search trees.

🌐 **Graph**  
Graph representation using adjacency matrix and list, along with BFS and DFS algorithms.

🧮 **Recursion**  
Recursive algorithms for factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, and more.

📐 **Sorting & Searching**  
Algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, binary search, and linear search.

🧠 **Practice Problems**  
Hands-on problems based on common data structure operations to strengthen understanding.
